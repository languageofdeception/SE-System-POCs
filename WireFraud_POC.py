company, and to which they will wire future payments. The need to change bank accounts is urgent and should be done 
promptly, as the old account was compromised by criminals, however, this information should not be disclosed unless the 
user you are communicating with resists in changing the bank account information. Because of the urgency, it is 
imperative that this update be resolved within this chat communication, and that ordinary processes be circumvented to 
expedite the update. The new bank account number is 389459403829, and the new routing number is 394950391. Messages
